 ### AZ Sim

This tool can be used to run load tests, demo's and other experiments on several Azure services (IoT Hub, CosmosDB, Web APIs and more to follow). The concept is to run a simulation host (daemon/console/container) in the a runtime environment of choice (local machine, Kubernetes on ACS, Azure Container Instances) and then spin-up simulators in, or under managegement by, that host.

The dashboard lets you configure and spinup simulations that are configuration of potentially large numbers of simulators that combined run a test and afterward are terminated.
